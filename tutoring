    <p class="muted">
      This page is for families and students who found me through outside listings (Craigslist, referrals, etc.).
      ObfusLabs is my security research studio; tutoring is the teaching side of what I do.

    <h2 id="tutoring-title" class="small">Hi, I'm Daniel — NYC-based STEM Tutor</h2>

    <p>
      I’m Daniel G., a math, science, and computer science tutor based in New York City.
      I work with high school, AP, and college students who want clear explanations, patient support, and
      a realistic connection between what they’re learning in class and how it shows up in the real world.
    </p>

    <p class="small">
      <strong>Education:</strong><br>
      Columbia University — B.A. in Physics &amp; Film Studies<br>
      New York University — M.S. in Computer Science (2022)
    </p>

    <h3>Teaching Approach</h3>
    <p>
      A lot of students hit a wall when physics, chemistry, or calculus suddenly stop feeling like “plug-and-chug”
      and start looking like a foreign language. Symbols pile up, formulas feel random, and homework questions look
      nothing like the examples from class.
    </p>
    <p>
      My job is to slow things down and make the ideas feel natural. If a formula is confusing, we take it apart:
      where it comes from, what each symbol means, and how to recognize when to use it. I don’t just hand over answers;
      I walk students through problems until the patterns start to feel familiar and intuitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don’t learn math and science by staring at notes—you learn by doing lots of problems the right way.
      I guide practice so students build both skill and confidence. At first progress can feel slow, but once the
      fundamentals lock in, everything accelerates.
    </p>

    <h3>Subjects I Tutor</h3>

    <p><strong>Math</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Algebra I &amp; II, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus</li>
      <li>Calculus I, AP Calculus AB/BC</li>
      <li>Introductory multivariable calculus (Calc III) for motivated students</li>
      <li>Introductory linear algebra &amp; differential equations (case-by-case; I’m happy to discuss your syllabus)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Physics</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regents Physics &amp; Honors Physics</li>
      <li>AP Physics 1 &amp; 2</li>
      <li>AP Physics C — Mechanics and Electricity &amp; Magnetism</li>
      <li>Algebra-based and calculus-based college Physics I &amp; II</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Chemistry</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>High School Chemistry (all levels), Regents &amp; Honors</li>
      <li>AP Chemistry</li>
      <li>College Chemistry I &amp; II</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      I actually started out as a chemistry kid at Brooklyn Tech, and it was the first subject I ever tutored.
      Even after shifting more toward physics, math, and computer science in college, I kept taking chemistry at Columbia
      and earned A’s in both College Chemistry I and II. That early background is a big part of why I still enjoy teaching chemistry so much.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Computer Science</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>AP Computer Science A</li>
      <li>Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C++ (and some C#)</li>
      <li>Intro algorithms &amp; data structures</li>
      <li>Intro computer networks &amp; operating systems concepts</li>
      <li>Foundations of cybersecurity (for curious high school or early-college students)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      My day job is in cybersecurity and software engineering, so when we do CS, I can connect abstract topics
      to how they show up in real systems, security, and modern software.
    </p>

    <h3>Rates</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In-person (NYC): <strong>$65/hour</strong></li>
      <li>Online (Zoom/Google Meet): <strong>$50/hour</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      I keep some flexibility for long-term weekly students or families juggling multiple subjects—if cost is a concern,
      we can usually find a structure that works.
    </p>

    <p class="small">
      When you reach out, feel free to include a photo of the syllabus, your latest test or quiz, or a few homework problems
      that are giving you trouble. That helps me hit the ground running in the first session.

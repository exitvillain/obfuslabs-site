    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Meet Dan Gray aka exitvillain</h2>
    <h3>He's a hacker cracker extraordinaire</h3>

    <p>Daniel studied physics as an undergraduate at Columbia University. Later, he earned a Master’s in Computer Science from NYU, where he studied distributed systems, operating systems, databases, machine learning, and several advanced security classes — including application security, network security, and offensive security. He also served as a teaching assistant for NYU's flagship graduate course, Internet Security and Privacy.</p>

    <p>While at NYU, Daniel was part of the OSIRIS cybersecurity research lab at the Tandon School of Engineering, where he contributed to hands-on offensive security research, internal tooling, and advanced red team scenarios.</p>

    <p>Daniel holds The Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) certification from TCM Security and is days away from securing two more red teaming certifications from Altered Security (CRTP), Zero-Point Security (CRTO). Each certification focused on a different aspect of Active Directory Attacks demonstrating hands-on experience ranging from Cobalt Strike operations to PowerShell abuse and living-off-the-land techniques for stealth and EDR evasion. But my focus is not on specific tools which change and eventually get detected, but on mastering the attack concepts that persist</p>

    <p>He is currently sharpening his skills in malware reverse engineering and exploit development through the RET2 Systems wargame platform, diving deep into memory corruption, shellcode, and system-level exploitation.</p>

    <p>You can contact Daniel at <a href="mailto:daniel.gray@obfuslabs.com">daniel.gray@obfuslabs.com</a> or visit his site at <a href="https://exitvillain.com" target="_blank">exitvillain.com</a> where he runs a hacker forum and other projects.</p>

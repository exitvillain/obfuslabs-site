  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Meet Dan Gray aka exitvillain</h2>
  <h3>He's a hacker cracker extraordinaire</h3>
  <p>Daniel studied physics as an undergraduate at Columbia University. Later, he earned a Master’s in Computer Science from NYU, where he studied distributed systems, operating systems, databases, machine learning, and several advanced security topics — including application security, network security, and offensive security. He also served as a teaching assistant for NYU's flagship graduate course, Internet Security and Privacy.</p>

  <p>While at NYU, Daniel was part of the OSIRIS cybersecurity research lab at the Tandon School of Engineering, where he contributed to hands-on offensive security research, internal tooling, and advanced red team scenarios.</p>

  <p>Daniel holds red teaming certifications from three of the industry's top cybersecurity companies: Altered Security (CRTP), TCM Security (PNPT), and Zero-Point Security (CRTO). Each certification focused on a different aspect of Active Directory attacks — from living off the land with PowerShell and Silver C2, to Kali-based internal network attacks, to full-scale operations using Cobalt Strike.</p>
  
  <p>He is currently sharpening his skills in malware reverse engineering and exploit development through the RET2 Systems wargame platform, diving deep into memory corruption, shellcode, and system-level exploitation.</p>

  <p>You can contact Daniel at <a href="mailto:daniel.gray@obfuslabs.com">daniel.gray@obfuslabs.com</a> or visit his site at <a href="https://exitvillain.com" target="_blank">exitvillain.com</a> where he runs a hacker forum and other projects.</p>

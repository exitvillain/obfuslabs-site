    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Meet Dan Gray aka exitvillain</h2>
    <h3>He's a hacker cracker extraordinaire</h3>

    <p>Daniel studied physics as an undergraduate at Columbia University. Later, he earned a Master’s in Computer Science from NYU, where he studied distributed systems, operating systems, databases, machine learning, and several advanced security topics — including application security, network security, and offensive security. He also served as a teaching assistant for NYU's flagship graduate course, Internet Security and Privacy.</p>

    <p>While at NYU, Daniel was part of the OSIRIS cybersecurity research lab at the Tandon School of Engineering, where he contributed to hands-on offensive security research, internal tooling, and advanced red team scenarios.</p>

    <p>Daniel holds The Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) certification from TCM Security and is days away from securing two more red teaming certifications from Altered Security (CRTP) and Zero-Point Security (CRTO). Each certification focused on a different aspect of Active Directory attacks — from living off the land with PowerShell and Silver C2, to Kali-based internal network attacks, to full-scale operations using Cobalt Strike.</p>
    
    <p>He is currently sharpening his skills in malware reverse engineering and exploit development through the RET2 Systems wargame platform, diving deep into memory corruption, shellcode, and system-level exploitation.</p>

    <p> Daniel is also trying to improve his web application security skills! Finished 149/269 Labs on Portswigger Academy which is all Burp Suite Web Application Security stuff. </p>

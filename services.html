  <h1>Future Idea: SOC-as-a-Service</h1>

  <p>
    This is not a real offering yet — it’s something I’d like ObfusLabs to grow into
    once there’s a bigger team, more tooling, and more experience behind it.
    I’m keeping this here so early supporters can see the long-term vision.
  </p>

  <h2>Why even think about a SOC?</h2>
  <p>
    A lot of companies want security visibility but can’t afford a giant SOC or a huge vendor.
    Long-term, I’d love to build a small, attacker-aware SOC that’s transparent, lightweight,
    and human — not a black-box portal full of noise.
  </p>

  <h2>What a future SOC at ObfusLabs might look like</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Human-first monitoring</strong> — people who actually understand attacker behavior,
      not generic alert processors.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Clear, concise escalation</strong> — “here’s what happened, here’s what it means,
      here’s what to do” instead of giant PDFs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Detection tuning</strong> with an offensive mindset — making sure alerts fire for real attacks
      while cutting down the noise.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Threat-hunting sessions</strong> that focus on learning and visibility rather than checkbox exercises.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Simple, terminal-friendly tooling</strong> instead of flashy dashboards — inspired by ObfuScope,
      my lab project.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What this is NOT (yet)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No 24/7 team.</li>
    <li>No SLAs.</li>
    <li>No enterprise onboarding process.</li>
    <li>No compliance mapping or formal IR retainer.</li>
    <li>No polished “product.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Right now, this is purely a direction I’d like to grow into.
    If you’re excited about the idea — or want to help shape it —
    feel free to reach out.
